                        In this project, I’ve been studying how the design and programming of public spaces can reduce incarceration by addressing its root causes.  The goal of the project is to challenge the way crime preventative design has been approached in the past and to ultimately design spaces preventative and alternative to the system by providing spaces for healing, trust, reparations, and restorative justice to take place.

                    <p> A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM AND ITS RELATION TO SEATTLE </p>
                    <p> The idea of a carceral state for punishment is a fairly new idea, emerging and booming after the Civil Rights Movement, which passed numerous legislations against segregation and discrimination including those of housing, voting, and employment discrimination.  The end of the Jim Crow era and segregation then the rapid rise of incarceration is a strong correlation showing that the system is built more so on racial and social oppression than crime and justice.  “Tough on Crime”, “Law and Order”, and War on Drugs pushing administrations were able to find a loophole in the 13th amendment, which states that slavery is acceptable only as punishment for crime.  The Prison Industrial Complex was born and the country built prisons and sentences larger than the crimes to capitalize off the labor of their people.  Today more than 2.3 million people, are sitting behind bars, in a modern day slavery. </p>
                    <p> The carceral state is not limited to the prison walls.  Once someone leaves prison, they are subject to discrimination for voting, housing, employment, education, food stamps, and other public benefits.  Today more than 6 million people are disenfranchised and half of americans have or have had a direct family member locked up.  Furthermore, we have the worlds highest recidivism rate, with 75% of those released going back into the system within 5 years.  All of these factors perpetuate a never-ending cycle of imprisonment and its consequences for a huge portion of American people. </p>
                    <p> In 2014 the Black Lives Matter movement was born.  In its platform there is the goal to redistribute funding from policing and prisons and flow it back to the communities most marginalized by this system.  Which brings me to why I chose Seattle as my city to focus this project in. </p>
                    <p> As for Seattle, it was originally occupied by the Duwamish Tribe until their land was exploited by American colonizers. The settlers made it an industrial town, promising jobs in fur trade, fishing, railroads, mining, timber, coal, and then later in the aerospace and defense industries which drew many African Americans here during the Great Migration.  Beginning in the 70’s corporations like Starbucks and Microsoft moved into the area and began gentrification.  Then with Amazon in the 90’s, traditionally Black communities like the Central District went from being 90% black to 20% in less than 10 years.  Many of these displaced people fell homeless, into addiction, and ultimately into the group most policed and imprisoned. </p>
                    <p> Over the last few years, the City has made efforts to create an Equity Masterplan that strives to improve quality of life for the people in these most at risk neighborhoods.  They have also ended prosecution for drug related charges, providing social services to help those people instead.  These efforts show that Seattle is a progressive city, proving that this summer with the murder of George Floyd and the creation of the CHOP/CHAZ, standing for the Capitol Hill Organized Protest and Autonomous Zone, displaying what a world without policing and prisons could look like – an equitable and loving place.  Furthermore, in September the city council voted to redistribute 100 million dollars from the SPD and invest it into BIPOC communities. </p>
                    <p> This project is listening to the wants and needs of the city, its people, and those from Seattle who have been incarcerated.  The key take-away I’ve drawn from these studies and conversations was the need for integration and building community, trust, and equity in the city and between it and its people. </p>

                 <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12">
                    <p>In the district plan, I am going to provide services and spaces that will be preventative of crime, need for policing, and incarceration. I am striving to increase equity through increased access to services, quality of life, and acceptance in the communities where it is most needed.  With the city making this effort to improve equity, it will begin to build a relationship and trust between the city and these communities, which is what those who have been incarcerated and policed say they need most to begin healing. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-8 col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12 col-12">
                    <p>
                        So I dove into research to understand the demographics of those most represented in the justice system.  In Washington, it was apparent that those who are people of color, lower income, and lesser educated are the ones disproportionally incarcerated.  I then associated these numbers and qualities geographically, overlapping them with the areas that receive a disproportionate amount of 911 calls and policing.  This revealed key areas that had all or a number of these disparities working against their communities.

                        Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds. Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.
