                        In this project, I’ve been studying how the design and programming of public spaces can reduce incarceration by addressing its root causes.  The goal of the project is to challenge the way crime preventative design has been approached in the past and to ultimately design spaces preventative and alternative to the system by providing spaces for healing, trust, reparations, and restorative justice to take place.

                    <p> A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM AND ITS RELATION TO SEATTLE </p>
                    <p> The idea of a carceral state for punishment is a fairly new idea, emerging and booming after the Civil Rights Movement, which passed numerous legislations against segregation and discrimination including those of housing, voting, and employment discrimination.  The end of the Jim Crow era and segregation then the rapid rise of incarceration is a strong correlation showing that the system is built more so on racial and social oppression than crime and justice.  “Tough on Crime”, “Law and Order”, and War on Drugs pushing administrations were able to find a loophole in the 13th amendment, which states that slavery is acceptable only as punishment for crime.  The Prison Industrial Complex was born and the country built prisons and sentences larger than the crimes to capitalize off the labor of their people.  Today more than 2.3 million people, are sitting behind bars, in a modern day slavery. </p>
                    <p> The carceral state is not limited to the prison walls.  Once someone leaves prison, they are subject to discrimination for voting, housing, employment, education, food stamps, and other public benefits.  Today more than 6 million people are disenfranchised and half of americans have or have had a direct family member locked up.  Furthermore, we have the worlds highest recidivism rate, with 75% of those released going back into the system within 5 years.  All of these factors perpetuate a never-ending cycle of imprisonment and its consequences for a huge portion of American people. </p>
                    <p> In 2014 the Black Lives Matter movement was born.  In its platform there is the goal to redistribute funding from policing and prisons and flow it back to the communities most marginalized by this system.  Which brings me to why I chose Seattle as my city to focus this project in. </p>
                    <p> As for Seattle, it was originally occupied by the Duwamish Tribe until their land was exploited by American colonizers. The settlers made it an industrial town, promising jobs in fur trade, fishing, railroads, mining, timber, coal, and then later in the aerospace and defense industries which drew many African Americans here during the Great Migration.  Beginning in the 70’s corporations like Starbucks and Microsoft moved into the area and began gentrification.  Then with Amazon in the 90’s, traditionally Black communities like the Central District went from being 90% black to 20% in less than 10 years.  Many of these displaced people fell homeless, into addiction, and ultimately into the group most policed and imprisoned. </p>
                    <p> Over the last few years, the City has made efforts to create an Equity Masterplan that strives to improve quality of life for the people in these most at risk neighborhoods.  They have also ended prosecution for drug related charges, providing social services to help those people instead.  These efforts show that Seattle is a progressive city, proving that this summer with the murder of George Floyd and the creation of the CHOP/CHAZ, standing for the Capitol Hill Organized Protest and Autonomous Zone, displaying what a world without policing and prisons could look like – an equitable and loving place.  Furthermore, in September the city council voted to redistribute 100 million dollars from the SPD and invest it into BIPOC communities. </p>
                    <p> This project is listening to the wants and needs of the city, its people, and those from Seattle who have been incarcerated.  The key take-away I’ve drawn from these studies and conversations was the need for integration and building community, trust, and equity in the city and between it and its people. </p>

                        <h1>District Plan</h1>
                    </div>
                </div>
                 <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12">
                    <p>In the district plan, I am going to provide services and spaces that will be preventative of crime, need for policing, and incarceration. I am striving to increase equity through increased access to services, quality of life, and acceptance in the communities where it is most needed.  With the city making this effort to improve equity, it will begin to build a relationship and trust between the city and these communities, which is what those who have been incarcerated and policed say they need most to begin healing. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-xl-6 col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 col-12">
                    <p>
                        So I dove into research to understand the demographics of those most represented in the justice system.  In Washington, it was apparent that those who are people of color, lower income, and lesser educated are the ones disproportionally incarcerated.  I then associated these numbers and qualities geographically, overlapping them with the areas that receive a disproportionate amount of 911 calls and policing.  This revealed key areas that had all or a number of these disparities working against their communities.

                    <p>
                        So I had my focus areas, now I had the question of what can be done to help these areas.  I wanted to create something that provided those resources and services that are most needed, those being but not limited to healthy food, health care, employment and economic gains, education, and community gathering and recreation.  I also wanted this space to be a place where the community can come together in search of nurturing, support, empowerment, representation, or anything else they may seek, and that by bringing them together it will build trust for the city and each other, building a sense of community, love, and support.  A space that can be by and for the people.

                 <p>So I designed a so called “container” to house these programs.  I chose to do a shipping container to speak to the industrial character of the port city and because its extremely affordable to implement.  This container was altered to be extremely flexible in it’s uses and abilities.  I imagine each of those identified areas to have at least one permanent container, which I’m calling a Flex-Pod, and then some have the opportunity for more temporary, pop-up containers on a day by day or to week to week basis. </p>
                 <img width="100%" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jw_FWdYWp13d6nYJ0v-vBIftPVEZ5EUdBGw2Q-L1GQ6bPoHJOb-P71m6gEB2neWRJZ51T4v1MDLghss4tP9agB4ed_RJA-aSmW-ZWWtv9y5-soFEgbtcu9qSFwzlHlBhdv8ffZiBXjQ=w2400">
                 <p>As far as the program for this Flex-Pod goes, I imagine it to be scheduled with the city to arrange hours or days for its focus to be on services such as basic health care, tutoring, job or skill training, libraries, meals on wheels, child care, and even as simple as just fun events like an ice cream social or yoga classes, these events and services will bring the community together and foster a relationship among neighbors and with their city. </p>
                 <p>When the city does not have a program scheduled, the Flex-Pod can be allotted to community members who may not be able to fund or commit to their own retail spaces.  This pod empowers these people by giving them a space to sell their goods or skills and build their wealth.  It can also be a space for existing businesses to occupy and market as a percentage of their profits going towards the families who may need it most for court fees, rent, tuition, food, and other necessities.  It can also be a space for support groups and other meetings to take place. </p>
                 <p>And when the pod is closed for business, it will still provide an interactive and versatile space for the community.  The area around the pod may respond in pavement changes, moveable furniture, and garden space.  And the walls of the container can be a space for local art and community engagement practices, gauging what the community may need or want in this or other public spaces. </p>
                 <p>This Flex-Pod becomes a permanent, flexible, and additive space in its communities that will listen to the community’s voices and ideas and become adopted by them, building that need for trust and a relationship between neighbors as well as with the city.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="col-xl-12 col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-12">
                    <div style="margin: auto; display: block; text-align: center;">
                        <img width="75%" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jEadWQBuuyn_fej0vE1KbHMZETJdfPqmMj0LTeMBnBpKkO9UJx27qFpeUwpAY6UNogkLslRsX4skwRMtUcRvHDK_cpRYWKodDXMY9N6fXgdOxiDjnHhvvUo15AwbL5yu1rM3ss1qHJM=w2400">
                    </div>
                 <p>So where will these pods go?  Bringing it back to the district plan, I’ve sited 8 permanent locations for them.  These were all sited in areas that have either good public transit, parking, and/or walkable access.  There was also an emphasis to site them in places that have existing programs where this could serve as a so called front porch for these services.  These areas that are already drawing people in and this Flex-Pod can build off of that.  And lastly, some areas were chosen to be highly public and visible, to make a point not to segregate these people and services away from the public eye, helping to integrate and build awareness and acceptance. </P>

                        Now at the site scale design, the goal of this site, like the district plan, will be preventative but also with a focus on alternative measures to incarceration.  The site itself is very interesting, straddling I-5 with the international district on the west side and Yesler Terrace, a racially integrated public housing development on the east.  It’s also quite close to the court house, city jail, and state police department.  With this location, there are many opportunities to engage with these existing nearby power houses and create a center for Restorative Justice that is easily accessible.  Restorative justice is an alternative measure to incarceration, where the victim and offender can speak and find other measures that can promote healing for both parties, which prisons never achieve.  It’s been proven more effective and restorative, working even in cases of murder.  Along with this program I see myself designing a healing garden that can promote a warm welcome, comfort and openness and lead to these uncomfortable conversations and ultimately healing.  I also want to promote some kind of educational and interpretive experience to educate the general public about incarceration, leading to wider acknowledgement and acceptance of these people and therefore helping to desegregate them from the public.  Finally, it will have opportunities for services, food production, and economic gain like the Flex-Pods served, as well as possibility for housing.

                       I’m still exploring options on how and where to site and design for these measures, but currently I’m drawn to capping a portion of I-5 and designing there.  This idea fits into the city’s 30 year masterplan which is to cap most portions of I-5 running through the city for green space and affordable housing.  It is also a powerful act to show the commitment to repairing and healing the harm I-5 did while simultaneously helping to heal the people in this neighborhood, those accused, and those returning from the carceral system.

                        By creating spaces throughout the city that are preventative and planning for a space that can be alternative, Seattle can become a precedent city for how justice can really be just, how a budget can be people focused and reduce the need for policing and punishment, and over all become a city built on trust, love, and healing. </p>

                        After the mid-year pin-up, I dove back into more reading, research, and diagramming.  Specifically about the power of food and farming as resistance, black and urban landscapes, healing spaces, restorative justice, and history of my site scale district.
